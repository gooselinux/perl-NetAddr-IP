Hi Tom and thanks for getting in touch.

Why do you say that the code is licensed under the 1.0 license?

According to this excerpt (from
http://search.cpan.org/src/LUISMUNOZ/NetAddr-IP-4.007/README )...

# LICENSE AND WARRANTY
# 
# This software is (c) Luis E. MuÃ±oz and Michael A. Robinton.  It can be
# used under the terms of the perl artistic license provided that proper
# credit for the work of the authors is  preserved in  the form  of this 
# copyright  notice and license for this module.

... there is no mention to a specific version number for the license.

I would be willing to relicense to Artistic 2.0 if need be. However, the
code is rather stable at this time. I think it would not be a wise use
of time to start tracking "upstream license version number" as well :-)

Of course. I'll tack a note to update the wording in the next release.

Best regards.
